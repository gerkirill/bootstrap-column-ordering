At wide screens (in 2-column mode) left column is shown at left, despite it comes under the main content div in the source.

At narrow screens (single column) left column is shown under main one (well, just like in the source).

index.html contains implementation for boostrap v.2.x, index-3.html - for bootstrap 3.x
